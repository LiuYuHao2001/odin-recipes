<h1>Lettuce Salad</h1>

<img src="../images/lettuce-salad.png" />

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  For something like this lettuce and Parmesan salad, try to use a crispy
  lettuce such as Romaine or red leaf lettuce (I used both to give me a little
  variety and good texture). You can also throw in some frisée lettuce, Belgian
  endive, or arugula, but be sure to start with Romaine lettuce and fill in with
  the rest.
</p>
<p>
  When buying your lettuce, look for crisp, bright-colored leaves, and avoid
  anything that looks dry or wilted. Some spotting or small holes are common,
  particularly if you’re buying organic lettuce that’s been grown without the
  use of sprays.
</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>
  This lettuce salad is my light and easy twist on a classic Caesar. You’ll
  need:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Lettuce: I used hearts of romaine lettuce and red leaf lettuce. As I
    mentioned above, any lettuce would work, but I like the varied textures and
    colors of the romaine and red leaf lettuce.
  </li>
  <li>
    Shallots, thinly sliced: For mild sharpness, sweetness, and great crunch.
    For bolder flavor, use thinly sliced red onions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Lemon zest: You’ll need the zest of 2 lemons. Save the juice to season the
    salad.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dressing: Lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil form one of the most basic
    salad dressings, with bright flavor from the lemon juice and a hint of
    pepperiness from the olive oil. I used our Spanish Hojiblanca EVOO because
    it is pungent, fruity, and ever so subtly bitter.
  </li>
  <li>
    Parmesan cheese: Some freshly grated Parmesan cheese adds some sharpness and
    nuttiness to the romaine lettuce salad. If you like tangier, sharper flavor,
    crumbled feta cheese would work as well.
  </li>
  <li>
    Crushed red pepper flakes or Aleppo-style pepper (optional): Red pepper
    flakes add subtle heat. For an even milder option, try Aleppo-style pepper,
    which is more sweet than spicy. Or, simply omit if you don’t like heat!
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Prepare the lettuce. Chop 1 to 2 hearts of romaine and 1 bundle of red leaf
    lettuce, and rinse and drain it very well. I recommend using a salad spinner
    to get rid of excess moisture. You can also give the lettuce a good shake.
    Pat dry thoroughly. If you have time, wrap the lettuce in paper towels and
    refrigerate for a little bit. This helps it crisp up.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make the lettuce salad. Grab a large salad bowl and add the lettuce, 2
    thinly sliced shallots, and the zest of 2 lemons. Keep the lemons! You need
    them for the next step.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the salad dressing. Season the salad with kosher salt, black pepper, the
    juice of 2 lemons, and ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil. Toss to combine.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add finishing touches and serve. Sprinkle 1 cup finely grated Parmesan
    cheese and some red pepper flakes (optional) and toss again. Serve and
    enjoy!
  </li>
</ol>
